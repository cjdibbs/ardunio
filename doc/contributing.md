# Contributing

The contributors are listed in [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) (add yourself).

We use the [C4.1 (Collective Code Construction Contract)](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:22)
process for contributions.
More discussions and explanations of the process can be found in the
[The ZeroMQ Community](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#Chapter-The-ZeroMQ-Community),
in particular [here](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all#The-ZeroMQ-Process-C).

Comments on the process:

> A patch MUST compile cleanly and pass project self-tests on at least the
> principle target platform.

In our case, this means that `./test` should run without failure.
