# Introduction

We believe that programming the [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) can be *more fun*
if we don't have to use the C language to program it. We aim to create a new
language that allows us to program the Arduino using higher-level
constructs. Our mission:

**Arduino programming without the hassle of C**
