# EDSL

Our language is embedded in the Haskell language. That means that when we write
programs in our language, we are actually writing Haskell programs.

However, our programs will not look like standard Haskell because they use
custom operators that are more suited to the FRP paradigm.

By hosting our language inside Haskell, as opposed to making up our own custom
syntax, we gain a few things:

* We don't have to write our own parser
* We can take advantage of Haskell's advanced type system

When we combine our program with the language library, we get an executable
that, when run, will produce a C file:

The executable is a compiler from our EDSL to C.
